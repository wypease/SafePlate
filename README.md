**Problem Statement**

The increasing number of people with food allergies need a smart, easy way to locate and create healthy foods quickly based on their dietary needs and/or restrictions.
Those impacted by this problem are any of the thirty-two million Americans that have a food allergy, as reported by the Allergy & Asthma Network (2023). Or simply those looking to try out new healthy and customizable food options. The problem of not having an available resource to find special dietary requirements for adults and children living with food allergies can lead to food insecurity. This issue also increases hospitalizations due to allergic reactions from consumed allergens, or from a lack of healthy food. Food allergies are a serious consideration, and should not be taken lightly. Developing food allergies is a common side effect of contracting COVID-19; therefore, many of those impacted are new to living with food restrictions (COVID Care Group, LLC, 2022). They may not be knowledgeable on where to successfully begin their new lifestyle changes. 








**Technology Solution**

The technology solution of SafePlate gives users the ability to locate places that serve food within their nutrition restrictions or find recipes for meals at home that meet their health needs. Our users can have the option to locate allergy-friendly restaurants by utilizing a map of their present location. If they plan to do some traveling, they can simply input any alternative address to find locations close by. Additionally, users can personalize their search results by specifying their dietary preferences or restrictions and potentially store this within their user account or profile. As new restaurants pop up in their area that offer food that meet the guidelines, they have set they will be notified. If somewhere offers newer menu options users on the app can go in and alert people that a place in the area is now offering new health friendly options. Lastly, our recipe search feature allows for users to input any meal restrictions they may have compiled with a type of meal they’re interested in making and pops out meal planning features. If you’re a user who is focused on a low carb diet, or have a gluten allergy, you can specify this when looking for a Pasta dish to make and find some great low carb or gluten free recipes. SafePlate is here to help you eat what you want and not feel limited.
